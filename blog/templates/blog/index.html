        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>
            I love programming and using my head to solve difficut problems. 
            I also enjoy helping others in exploring new technologies in general!
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to keep on growing as a developer - and if I could help 
            you do the same, that would bring me extreme joy!
        </p>
